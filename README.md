### Custom Subreddit Font

Adopt a custom font for your whole subreddit. Font must exist on the user's local machine, so be sure to include web-safe fallbacks.

### Custom Subreddit Name Logo

Change the /r/Whatever text to be an image of your choice

### Full Screen Subreddit Bar

Based off of work in [/r/Android](https://reddit.com/r/Android) and [/r/Nexus6P](https://reddit.com/r/Nexus6P). By default, Naut clips off the Subreddits bar at the top of the screen and puts user info in the top right corner. This moves the userbar down and expands the Subreddit bar to be full-width again!

### Sidebar Image

If you want to add an  image in your sidebar, here's an easy way to do so. Make sure it's the right width (268px by default in Naut)!

### Sliding and Spinning Subreddit Logo

A simple little CSS animation for your Sub's logo. Demo available at [/r/ProjectFi](https://github.com/r/ProjectFi)

### Sliding Subreddit Logo

An even simpler CSS animation for your Sub's logo. Just spins! Demo available at [/r/Nexus5X](https://github.com/r/Nexus5X)
